Mentoring is one of my absolute favorite parts of my job, and mentorship
meetings are always highlights of my day. This was not something I expected to 
enjoy as much as I do, and so I figured I'd write down my thoughts on it in case
it helps spur others to start mentoring.

## Why Mentor?

First off, it feels great! Some of that is from the warm fuzzies I get knowing that I'm helping
people navigate their careers better and maybe (just maybe) avoid doing some of the dumb things
I did when I was starting out. But honestly, most of it is because it's awesome to have people come to you, 
respectfully ask for
your advice on things, and then listen in rapt attention as you talk about yourself. Where else
can you get that kind of vibe[^impostor]? 

Secondly, it looks good come performance management time. Having demonstrable impacts outside
of your team/project is generally seen as a value-add, and for more senior roles may actually
be a requirement[^requirement].

Finally, I think it's surprisingly high-leverage, and one of the more impactful things I do.
It's very easy to spend 100% of your time with your small team as you fight to complete projects on
deadline. Mentoring helps me get out of my silo and share what I've learned outside of my org,
which creates information and influence channels that wouldn't exist otherwise[^networking].


## How I Mentor

I set up mentorships in what I believe is a fairly common pattern.

* **Monthly 30 minute meetings.** You don't
  want to meet so rarely that you miss opportunities to advise and influence, and you don't
  want to meet so frequently that you often don't have anything new to talk about[^scheduling].
  I find 30 minutes per month to be a good compromise, although feel free to adjust to whatever
  works for you and your mentee. 
* **The mentee owns the agenda.** 
* **Take notes.**
* **We can stop at any time.**

## How to Get Started
* Realize that you have good advice to offer, even if you feel like you don't. Even talking about 
the times you screwed up can be valuable. 


[^impostor]: 
   It's also great for keeping my impostor syndrome at bay. It's hard to feel like I'm a fraud
   when I tell people my opinions and they're like "yes, I see, that's a good point!"
   
[^requirement]:
   This may be explicit or implicit. At my company there's no hard requirement for broader
   contributions, but if everyone else at your level is doing it and you aren't it looks
   bad. 
   
[^networking]:
   It's also great for networking and building your personal brand, which can make it easier
   both to recruit people for your team and to find other places in the company with projects you might
   be interested in working on.
   
[^scheduling]:
   I also usually ask my mentee to own the calendar invite for the mentorship meetings.
